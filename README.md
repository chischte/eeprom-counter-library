Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.
Argument 1

Type: String
Default: 'default value'

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide an example below.

Example:

awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"

Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.
Contributing

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called CONTRIBUTING.md (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license. Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
